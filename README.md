# Operational-transformation-gis
A simple implementation of operational transformation function coupled with web gis editor. It reuses Mozilla's TogetherJS's OT function TextReplace, modified to handle coordinates instead of characters. The modified function was named CoordsReplace.

For simplicity everthing packed within a html file.

Some basic instructions on how it works within the GUI when started.
Will work started from users local hdd, only OpenLayers pulled from the web.
